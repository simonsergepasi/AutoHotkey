1. **Cascade.ahk**:
   - **Description**: This script arranges all open windows in a cascading pattern on the desktop. It sequentially positions each window, starting from the top-left corner of the screen and offsetting each subsequent window slightly downward and to the right. This cascading arrangement allows users to easily see and switch between multiple open windows.

2. **Close all.ahk**:
   - **Description**: This script closes all open windows on the desktop with a single command. It provides a quick way to clear the screen of all active windows, which can be useful for quickly resetting the workspace or closing multiple applications at once.

3. **Position window.ahk**:
   - **Description**: This script allows the user to reposition the active window to various predefined positions on the screen using the Windows key in combination with a numpad number (e.g., Win + Numpad 1 for the bottom-left corner). This provides an easy and efficient way to organize windows on the screen for multitasking or to quickly move windows to specific locations.

4. **Start at fixed position.ahk**:
   - **Description**: This script ensures that all new windows launched from the Start menu open at a predefined, fixed position on the screen. It helps maintain a consistent and organized desktop layout by automatically positioning new windows where the user prefers them, rather than letting them open at random or default positions.

5. **WriteHere (alt F2).ahk**:
   - **Description**: This script keeps the keyboard focus locked on a specific window, regardless of mouse movements or other actions that might normally change the active window. The user can toggle this focus-locking feature on or off using the shortcut Alt + F2. This is particularly useful for situations where continuous input to a single window is needed without interruption, such as during data entry or while typing in a chat or document.
